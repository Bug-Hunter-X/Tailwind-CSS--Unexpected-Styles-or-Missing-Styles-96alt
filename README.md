# Tailwind CSS: Unexpected Styles or Missing Styles

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: unexpected styles or missing styles due to configuration problems or unused classes.

## The Problem

The provided `SomeTailwindComponent.jsx` file uses Tailwind CSS classes (`text-3xl`, `font-bold`, `bg-gray-100`, `p-4`, `text-gray-600`).  However, if these classes are not correctly defined in your `tailwind.config.js` file or are purged because they are not actually used in your application, the component will render with unexpected styles or even fail to render correctly. This is a frequent source of frustration for developers new to Tailwind.
